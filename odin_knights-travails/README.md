# Knights Travails

The task is to find the shortest path to get from one square to another and output all the squares where the knight stops along the way.

The solution of the problem in the knights-travails-BFS file, where the breadth-first search algorithm is implemented (and there's also a cool console output, check it out!)

A file with a deep search algorithm just finds a possible path, not the optimal one.
